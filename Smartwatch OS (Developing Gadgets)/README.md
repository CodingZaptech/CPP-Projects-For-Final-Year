# Smartwatch OS Simulation (C++ Project)

## Introduction
This Smartwatch OS Simulation demonstrates a simplified smartwatch operating system built in C++. It shows the current clock, counts steps, calculates calories burned, and allows resetting data. This is a backend simulation demonstrating how C++ can manage gadget functionalities.  

## Features
- Display current **clock** using system time  
- **Record steps** and maintain a running total  
- **Calculate calories burned** based on steps  
- **Reset data** to start a new session  
- Simulation of smartwatch backend functionality  

## Required Technologies
- **C++ programming language**  
- **I/O Streams** (`cin`, `cout`)  
- **Standard Library** (`ctime`, `iomanip`)  

## How to Run
1. Save as `SmartwatchOS.cpp`  
2. Compile: g++ SmartwatchOS.cpp -o smartwatchOS
