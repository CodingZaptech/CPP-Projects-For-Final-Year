# Search Engine (C++ Project)

## Introduction
This is a simple Search Engine simulation built in C++. It allows users to search through a collection of documents stored in a file. The search is case-insensitive and displays all matching results.  

## Features
- Search for keyword matches in document content  
- Display search results with titles and content  
- Backend simulation using file storage  

## Required Technologies
- **C++ programming language**  
- **I/O Streams** (`cin`, `cout`, `ifstream`)  
- **Standard Library** (`vector`, `string`, `algorithm`)  

## How to Run
1. Save the file as `SearchEngine.cpp` and prepare `documents.txt`  
2. Compile the program:   g++ SearchEngine.cpp -o searchEngine
