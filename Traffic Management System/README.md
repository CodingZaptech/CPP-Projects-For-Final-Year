# Traffic Management System (C++ Project)

## Introduction
The Traffic Management System simulates vehicle flow at an intersection. It manages traffic using queues for each direction (North, South, East, West).  

## Features
- Add cars with license plate and direction  
- Control traffic with a cycle (release one car per direction)  
- Display cars waiting in all queues  
- Backend simulation using queues  

## Required Technologies
- **C++ Programming Language**  
- **I/O Streams** (`cin`, `cout`)  
- **Standard Library Queues** (`<queue>`)  

## How to Run
1. Save the file as `TrafficManagementSystem.cpp`  
2. Compile the program: g++ TrafficManagementSystem.cpp -o trafficApp
